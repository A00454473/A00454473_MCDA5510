# Hello Class

### Hi, I am Rishan Deril Mascarenhas. My A# is A00454473 and I can be reached via email at rishancanada@gmail.com or rishan.mascarenhas@smu.ca
### I have done my Bachelor of Engineering in Information Technology from Mumbai, India and then worked for a year as Software Engineer. I've mainly worked on Full-stack development including Angular, Python (Flask), major relational databases and MongoDB. Though my primary project consisted of Data Analysis where I worked on various concepts from Data Integration to Visualization and Reporting.


## What bought us together?
### One of my favorite cuisines is Hyderabadi Chicken Biryani which is one of the interesting commonalities that bought our group together.


## My group 
### 1. Rishan Deril Mascarenhas from Mumbai, India
* I have a passion for both Data and Software development. Iâ€™ve worked in both fields for a brief period of time and want to learn the advances in their relevant technologies and explore how we can integrate data analysis and product engineering & development. Hence this is why I chose to pursue the MCDA program.
* One of my favorite cuisines is Hyderabadi Chicken Biryani which is one of the interesting commonalities that bought our group together.
